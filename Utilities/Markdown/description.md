# Description


## General

This is a tool to create a structured html (html5) document from a single markdown file
(GitHub flavoured markdown). Additionally this conversion tool will enrich the generated
document with:

* a table of content for an easier navigation
* a numbering of chapters and parapgraphs is added
* an index with references to all tables
* an index with references to all images 


## Goals

During development markdown files are used to document various aspects of the development
process and the software being developed. The documentation may even be split into several
distinct markdown files, in which case these have to be concatenated accordingly. This
tool is provided to automate (i.e. with Apache ANT) the generation of such a documentation.
