Revision Control Guidelines
===========================

Git is used as revision control system. GitHub contains the
central repository.

Currently changes are commited to the main branch. The main
branch is supposed to contain code which can be compiled and
that the unit tests are executable.

If needed this approach might be changed in the future.
