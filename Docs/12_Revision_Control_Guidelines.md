Revision Control Guidelines
===========================

Git is used as revision control system. GitHub contains the central repository.

Currently changes are commited to the main branch. The main branch is supposed
to contain code which can be compiled and that the unit tests are executable.

If needed this approach might be changed in the future.


Note: When checking in changes to the code then a text diff should show the
essential changes. Try to avoid "noise" due to unnecesary white space
characters or similar.
