Infrastructure
==============

General
-------

The main goal is to provide the development project in a way that development
can be done without the need to set up a huge infrastructure.

The minimum viable configuration is a single computer with just a few
development tools. Thus developers should be able to work independently
without interference.

The development project will contain various scripts with which a
continuous integration and continuous delivery scheme may be set up.
